Socket.io to achieve real time communication. Realtime Dataflow via sockets .
Changes made in folder structure -> transfer all frontend files inside public folder.
                                    Make app.js for server part.(outside public folder.)
JS library is Socket.io-- >> 1. first we will make a server using express   -> npm init (enter)
                                install npm i socket.io and npm install express
                                server initialize and listen and start(by node app.js on terminal)
                                To run socket.io in frontend -> search socketio cdn, and copy script tag from client installation setInterval
                                And paste in index.html just below canvas tag
                                To connect frontend with server -> write 1 more script tag -> let socket = io.connect("http://localhost:8080", {transports: ['websocket']});
                                So now we open any number of localhost of 8080 it connects with backend
